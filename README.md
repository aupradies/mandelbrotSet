I believe I should credit the two tutorials I followed closely:
https://youtu.be/xjjmkg9J7Gg?si=baey6DO80gsj8tIL
https://www.pythoninformer.com/generative-art/fractals/burning-ship/

there are two simple init commands at the end, one to comment and one to use - depends on whether you wanna see mandelbrot or the burning ship
width, height (amount of pixels/details) as well as iteration count (accuracy and better colors) are there to modify
